#file should start with #!bin/sh
#Regex in shell follows Posix Standard
#grep:General regular expression print
#	it prints the matched line the whole line 
#	ex: ls /user/bin | grep  zip -> it will print all lines which has the value zip
#	it can has options such as grep -i  to ignore case senstivty or grep -v to negate match
#	meta charchter in grep:
#		. -> it will match any character ex: 
			grep -e ".*mhx" file.txt #will match a.mhx bmhx
			grep -e ".\.mhx" file.txt # will match only a.mhx because we escaped . by backslash which means it should a dot character
#		$ -> end with ex:
			grep -e "\.mhx$" # matches .mhx
#		^ -> starts which only when there is no bracket
#		^ -> inside [] means except [^"] -> except "
		grep -e "^(ab|cd|ed)" file.txt #any thing which "sarts" with ac or cd or ed
		grep  -e "^ab|cd|ed" file.txt  # any thins starts with ac or "contians" cd or ed
#		? -> option matches one  or more occurence ex:
			grep -e "\(?1\)?" # here is the () as options it matches (1), (1, 1 and  1) 
#		* -> zero or many occurence 
#		+ -> at least one occurence 
#		() -> is grouping the condition 
#		[] -> range which interperter as "ONE" character ex:
			grep [0-9] # matches only one digit
			grep [0-9]* # matches as many number as possible
			
		md5_calc=`md5sum ${FILE_NAME} | grep -Eo '^[^ ]+'` -> write the value in variable -> rememerb use `` to write the data in variable
		
		if [[ $x == /fw* ]]  -> u can test part of the string using wild card
		
		z=`cat ./md5.txt| grep -Eo '^[0-9][0-9]' | tail -1 `  -> USING HEAD AND TAIL U CAN CONTROL WHICH OCCURENCE U ARE INTERESTED IN 
		

#	tar -C foldertoextractat -x file.tgz -> extract because it is x and -C means extract in this location
		-C => capital c means change directory 
	tar -C "directory to go to" -cvfz "filetoCreate" "from what" 
	tar -C /root/file -cvpzf "file.tg.pz" ./
#	tar -c foldertoextractat -x file.tgz -> extract because it is x and -c means extract in this location
# 	tar -xzvf file.tar.gz -> x=> extract file, z=> for file which is .gz , v => show progress, f=> file name

#  	rm -rf -> remove recursively and force 		
		
#sed: streams editor
#it takes -e option for exdtended regualr expressions ex:
	sed -e 's/^[ /t]//' file.txt # remove any space or tap in front of the file 
#it takes -i for changing in place ex:
	sed -i 's/low/high/' file.txt #change low with high 
#it can takes number for matching address in each line ex:
	sed -i '2s/low/high/' file.txt #changes the second match in every line
# it can change every match 
	sed -i 's/low/high/g' #by using g which means global matches
# to get the matches regular expression using sed:
	x= sed -e 's/.*file="\([^"]\)/\1/' # get the matches values of () in x --> very very very imprtant before this step should only one line avaliable you should filter the text before this point
	
#awk: 
awk -F ':' 'print $1' file.txt #print first colum which is septerted by :
# using awk to print the second matched line ex:
awk 'file/{i++}i==2/' file.txt

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#string matching short and long match
string1='folder1/folder2/folder3/f.txt'
longestleft=${string1##*/} # longest path from left will get f.txt
shortestleft=${string1#*/}  #shortest path from right will get folder2/folder3/f.txt
rightmatch=${longestleft%%*.} #  git folder name . is only a dot u can exchange it with / to work with folder
${file%/*} -> remove the file and get only the folder name 

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#If statment in Bash
if[-n "$1"]; then # -> is true when the string is not NULL
if[-z "$1"]; then # -> is true when the string is  NULL
if[-f "$1"]; then # -> test if it is a file
if[-d "$1"]; then # -> test if it is a folder
if[-e "$1"]; then # -> test if it exists
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# return from file to bash
$? -> what has the last command returned ex: u excute .c file and want to know what the file returned 
$! -> the PID of the last executed script in Backgroud using &
x = $(file.c >> file.txt) -> x whould be what have sent printf.

# to redirect the error u can use 2>&1
	cat file > file2 2>&1

# to make a device u can use mknod command 
	mknod /dev/chardevicetest c 8 1 // u create a character device which has a majpr numbher of 8 abnd minor number of 1 

# to execute shell inside another shell u can always uses "source" command the idea behind source is that shell copy the file to the other file which means all the variabe in the
#  under file are seen from the first file	
	source test.sh 
	. test.sh # . is alias to source 

# to assign a default value to variable if the variable doesnot exit 
	mode=${1:-start} # if the first argument doesnot exit assign start to mode
